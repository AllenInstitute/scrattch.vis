\title{Dendrogram plots for grouped samples with annotation barplots}
\usage{
group_dend_bar_plot(anno, dend, dend_group, leaf_labels = TRUE,
  font_size = 7, grouping = NULL, count_bars = TRUE,
  count_cutoff = NULL, count_log = FALSE, panel_pad = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{anno}{Sample annotations. The first column should be sample_name, and each annotation should have \_id, \_label, and \_color columns}

\item{dend}{Cluster/group dendrogram. The labels of the dendrogram should match one of the \_label columns in anno.}

\item{dend_group}{The base of the group that matches dendrogram to anno (e.g. "cluster" if "cluster_label" matches anno).}

\item{leaf_labels}{Logical, whether or not to plot the leaf labels. Default is TRUE.}

\item{font_size}{Numeric, the size of the leaf labels to plot. Default is 7.}

\item{grouping}{The base(s) of groups to use for generating barplots (e.g. "cluster" for "cluster_label" in anno). Default is NULL.}

\item{count_bars}{Logical, whether or not to display a barplot showing the size of each dend_group.}

\item{count_cutoff}{Numeric, the maximum size to display in the count_bars. Clusters with > count_cutoff will have truncated bars.}

\item{count_log}{Logical, whether or not to log scale the count_bars. Helpful for showing small groups.}

\item{panel_pad}{Numeric, the fraction of the dendrogram/bar line to use as padding between panels.}
